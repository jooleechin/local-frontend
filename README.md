# [han(:)gul](http://hangul.surge.sh/) 
[han(:)gul](http://hangul.surge.sh/) is a React browser application that will teach a user how to read and pronounce basic Korean characters. A user will be able to study Korean consonants and syllables at their own pace. Afterwards, they can take a quiz that will test their fundamental understanding of Korean characters utilizing the [spaced-repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) technique.
